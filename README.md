I bought a Ford Transit weeks ago to travel through europe for the next months.
If you travel you need a Home on the Road, we had not enough money buy a real RV
so we decided to build a very simple one.
The most important part is a:
* bad
* storage place
* power
I will provide in this project all informantion i gather during the building 
process.
